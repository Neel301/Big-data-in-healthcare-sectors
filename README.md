# Big-data-in-healthcare-sectors
- Predicted whether or not an individual has a disease using data processing, data visualization, and data prediction methods.

For this project you need Anaconda navigator and machine learning libraries pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn.   
I have used Linear regression, decision tree, and random forest method. 

Find here scikit learn documentation see [official website](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

With the use of Machine learning algorithm it predicts that patients has diesease or not.
